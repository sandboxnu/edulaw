          Our PRS tool can help you file a PRS complaint by walking you through
          the process of writing and submitting the complaint. The tool asks
          questions about your concerns to identify specific legal rights that
          may have been violated.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          These guides provide an overview of the rights that are included in
          the guides, so that you can get an idea of whether your concerns fit
          within the information included in the guides. Explore the guides
          below to learn more about what kinds of situations are included in the
          tool.

        <h2 id="school-discipline">School Discipline & Education</h2>
        <br />
        <p>
          Students have the right to be free from unjust discipline. The tool
          covers students’ legal rights when a school is trying to suspend or
          expel them.
        </p>

            <strong>What is a suspension?</strong>
          </em>
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          A student is suspended if they are excluded from their classroom. This
          includes both in-school and out-of-school suspensions.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>A student is suspended if: </p>
        <br />
        <DiscUl>
          <li>They are not allowed to come to school</li>
          <li>They are sent home early</li>
          <li>
            They are in the school building, but they aren&apos;t allowed to be
            in their regular classroom for more than half of the school day. For
            example, if they have to sit in the principla&apos;s office.
          </li>

          </em>
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          A student is expelled if they are excluded from their classroom for
          more than 90 days. This includes students who are excluded
          indefinitely or permanently.
        </p>

          <strong>
            There are different laws and requirements depending on the reason
            the school is disciplining the student.{' '}
          </strong>
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          The tool covers the requirements for all three types of discipline:{' '}
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          <strong>Code of Conduct Violations:</strong>
          <br />
          The school is accusing the student of breaking a school rule.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          <strong>Expellable Offenses: </strong>
          <br />
          The school is accusing the student of bringing a weapon or drugs to
          school, or assaulting school staff.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          <strong>Felony Complaint:</strong>
          <br />
          The school is excluding the student because of a felony complaint or
          adjudication that is unrelated to school.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          <em>
            <strong>
              How do I know why the school is disciplining the student?
            </strong>
          </em>
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          The school has to tell the student and their parent/guardian why
          they’re disciplining the student. If the school told you about the
          discipline in writing, the information should be in that letter or
          email. Call the EdLaw Project intake line if you’re not sure why the
          student is being disciplined.
        </p>
        <br />
        <br /> <br />
        <h2 id="special-education">Special Education</h2>
        <br />
        <p>
          Students with disabilities have the right to a public education that
          meets their needs. The tool covers the requirements for the process of
          identifying whether a student has a disability, determining what kinds
          of services they need, and making a plan for the student to access the
          services.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          <strong>
            Please note that the tool only covers the requirements for the
            special education process.
          </strong>
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          The questions will identify issues where the school clearly did or
          didn’t do something (for example, the school didn’t follow the right
          timeline for an evaluation, or the school isn’t providing the services
          in the student’s IEP).
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          The questions don’t cover disagreements about what the student needs
          (for example, whether the student is eligible for special education
          services, or whether the student needs to be in a smaller classroom),
          because those situations require more specific details about the
          student.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          Sometimes, a school follows the right process, but the special
          education plan the school offers doesn’t work for the student. If that
          is the case, the questions in the tool won’t address all of your
          concerns. Call the EdLaw Project intake line if you have questions
          about whether your situation can be addressed through a PRS complaint,
          or if other steps might make more sense.

        <h2 id="bullying">Bullying</h2>
        <br />
        <p>
          A student is being bullied when another student’s (or group of
          students’) actions hurt them. Bullying can be when: <br /> <br />
        </p>
        <DiscUl>
          <li>
            A student harms another student, or makes the student think that
            they’re going to harm them. The harm can be physical or emotional.
          </li>
          <li>
            A student damages another student’s property, or makes the student
            think they’re going to damage their property.
          </li>
          <li>
            A student creates a hostile environment at school that interferes
            with another student’s education.
          </li>
          <li>
            A student interferes with another student’s right to learn at school{' '}
          </li>
          <li>A student disrupts the school’s operations</li>
        </DiscUl>
        <br />
        <p>
          Students have the right to have their schools prevent and respond to
          bullying. The tool covers the requirements the school has to follow
          when they learn a student has been bullied, and the requirements for
          the school to have a Bullying Prevention Plan in place.
