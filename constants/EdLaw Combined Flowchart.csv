28,Process,Flowchart Shapes,2,3,,,,,,,"Students with disabilities need schooling that works for them. This guide explains the steps in the special education process. It starts from the first request for an evaluation. 
This guide talks about the steps for:
•	Learning if a student has a disability
•	Making a plan for the student to get needed services 
•	Keeping the plan updated every year
The guide helps figure out if a school followed the right steps.  Sometimes, a school follows the right steps, but the plan does not work for the student. If this happens, this guide won't answer all of your questions.
